# Mushroom Classification with SVM using R

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories using R programming language.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration:** Investigates the dataset, visualizes class distributions, and explores feature relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset, removes irrelevant features, and splits data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes SVM to build a classification model on the training data.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F-measure.

## Dependencies

- `plotly`
- `kernlab`
- `ggplot2`
- `visdat`
- `lattice`
- `caret`
- `e1071`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jrzvnn/mushroom-svm.git
```

2. Run the R script:

```
Rscript mushroom_svm.R
```

3. View the model performance and analysis results.
